To set up the repo, do the following:

1. Create a python virtualenv named venv in the root of the repository - note that this won't be noticed by git.
    - To do this, run `python -m venv venv` from inside the repo. This will only work if youp have python in your path
2. Activate the virtual environment through running the activate script - `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. When activated, the command line should say (venv) at the front. Now you can install your requirements for the project from requirements.txt.
    - To install requirements, run the following: `pip install -r requirements`
